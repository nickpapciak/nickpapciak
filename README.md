Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a student developer at Georgia Tech, just trying to learn something new every day.
  
### ðŸ“– some tech books I've enjoyed: 
  - Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software
  - Mathematics for Machine Learning
  - Rust's *the book*
  - Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (goated book for learning python)
  - Deep Learning
